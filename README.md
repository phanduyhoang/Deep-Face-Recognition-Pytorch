# Deep-Face-Recognition-Pytorch
The dataset used in the project is from Kaggle. You can search"people dataset in the wild..." or something like that as positive example for Siamese Network. It's pretty easy to find.

For positive image(the face that needs to detect) I used downloaeded images from the internet. there is a library in python alllowing automate this crawling process making life easy.
